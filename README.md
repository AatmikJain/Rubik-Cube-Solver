# Rubik’s Cube Solver

This project is guide for beginners who want to solve any scrambled rubik’s cube.
A visual guide which demonstrates steps to follow to solve rubik’s cube with speed.



## Procedure
1.	Player will feed the images of all sides of cube according to predefined way.
2.	Application will process an individual image to identify colors of nine squares of one face of cube.
3.	In return we will have sequence of steps as outcome, on following which will solve the rubik’s cube.
4.	Execution of generated steps will be implemented  by the visual effects, which helps the player to understand and follow the steps properly.
